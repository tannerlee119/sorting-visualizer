## Sorting Visualizer in React

I wanted to learn about different sorting algorithms. Became interested from watching videos such as [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg). 

## Available Scripts

Navigate to the project directory,
```powershell
cd Sorting-Visualizer
```

Then run the following:

```powershell
npm install
```
```powershell
npm audit fix
```
If that doesn't work try:
```powershell
npm audit fix --force
```
Then to run the app run:
```powershell
npm start
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### Dependencies
Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### What I Learned
* About sorting algorithms and how implement them in a visual way.
* How to utilize asynchronous functions
* A lot about CSS styling.
